# Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) Vending App

This is a showcase of a PPE vending app I created, providing easy access to personal protective equipment. Here are some screenshots of the key features:

## Admin Settings Screen

This is the Admin Settings screen, where administrators can manage and configure the vending machine.

## Card Scanner Screen

The Card Scanner screen is where users scan their card to initiate a purchase.

## Keypad Selection Screen

Once a card is scanned, users are directed to the Keypad Selection screen to select the items they want to purchase.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my PPE vending app. I'm always looking to improve and welcome any feedback!
